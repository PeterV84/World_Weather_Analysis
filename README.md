# World_Weather_Analysis

This project involved mapping out a vacation destination that suited the temperature parameters of the subject. The temperature was between 75-85 degrees. Once that had been established, the Hotels that fit that description were narrowed down to a geographical location. From there, four Hotels were established and a destination map was portrayed with googlemaps.
